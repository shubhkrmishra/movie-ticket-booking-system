Movie Ticket Booking System
Overview

The Movie Ticket Booking System is a backend project developed using Spring Boot (Java 17) and MySQL.
It allows users to search and book movie tickets online while providing admin capabilities for managing movies and shows.
The project enforces Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), supports promotional discounts, and ensures safe concurrent seat booking through transactional and locking mechanisms.

Tables

users ‚Üí store user info with role (ADMIN/CUSTOMER)

movies ‚Üí movie master data

shows ‚Üí scheduled movie shows

seats ‚Üí seats per show

bookings ‚Üí booking header with totals and promo

booked_seats ‚Üí booked seats per booking

promo_codes ‚Üí available promotional codes

Booking Flow
1. Customer selects show & seats

User picks available seats from /api/shows/{id}/seats.

2. API call: /api/bookings

Request Example

{
  "showId": 101,
  "seatNumbers": ["A1", "A2"],
  "promoCode": "FREESEAT1"
}

3. Validation steps

Validate show timing and seat availability.

Lock selected seats using @Lock(PESSIMISTIC_WRITE) to prevent concurrent conflicts.

If any seat is already booked ‚Üí return 409 Conflict.

Validate and apply promo (if eligible).

4. Booking confirmation

Response Example

{
  "bookingId": 501,
  "seats": ["A1", "A2"],
  "subtotal": 500.00,
  "discount": 250.00,
  "total": 250.00,
  "promoApplied": "FLAT250",
  "status": "CONFIRMED"
}

Security & Authentication

Users register via /api/auth/register (default role: CUSTOMER)

Login via /api/auth/login

JWT token returned in response ‚Üí used for all subsequent requests in headers:

Authorization: Bearer <token>


Access Control:

/api/admin/** ‚Üí ADMIN only

/api/bookings/** ‚Üí CUSTOMER only

/api/movies/**, /api/shows/** ‚Üí open (read-only)

Concurrency Handling

To prevent double booking:

Seats are locked using Pessimistic Lock (@Lock(LockModeType.PESSIMISTIC_WRITE)) during booking.

Each seat has a unique constraint in booked_seats table.

If two users try to book the same seat simultaneously:

One transaction succeeds.

The other fails with 409 Conflict: Seat already booked.

Promo Logic
Condition	Eligible
Total bookings > 5	‚úÖ Yes
OR Total amount spent > ‚Çπ1500	‚úÖ Yes
Types

FREE_SEAT ‚Üí Discount = 1 seat‚Äôs price.

FLAT_250 ‚Üí ‚Çπ250 off (max up to total amount).

Validation

Expired or inactive promo codes are rejected.

Ineligible users cannot apply promo codes.
